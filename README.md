Title: Irish History timeline


Timeline:
Early on in the project I decided to use a heavily modified version of another timeline to allow for a more sophisticated interactive website. The timeline I eventually used was based on this source: https://codepen.io/cjl750/pen/mXbMyo. Originally, I had difficulty getting the interactive aspects of the timeline to work in my local server - I eventually discovered the reason to be that I had not installed JQuery on my local 

Debugging:
There were several teething problems early on in the project. I could not get the map to appear in the first place, so I used Chrome to inspect the console (I was developing my website in atom). Using the console there, I saw that i had accidentally used a regular bracket instead of a curly brace to close an object in my initMap function.

References/additional help:
I used a variety of YouTube and printed resources to help develop my project. Essential in the implementation of my Google Maps funcitonality was both the relevant pages of the Code Institute online programme and Traversy Media's video entitled "Google Maps JavaScript API Tutorial" (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zxf1mnP5zcw).

In terms of books used, Javascript & JQuery by Jon Duckett was an indespendible resource.
