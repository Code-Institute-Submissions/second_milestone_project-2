      <p>36th Ulster division suffers serious losses at the Battle of the Somme in 1916, a date that enters both Nationalist and Unionist popular memory for very different reasons.</p>
      <p>The Government of Ireland Act of 1920 was intended to make two sub-states of the United Kingdom in both Ireland and Northern Ireland, but after Sinn Féin won a majority in Ireland in the general election of 1918, a war broke out between Irish republicans and the British forces in Ireland. When the war ended, a new 'Free State' had been established in 26 counties of Ireland, but the 6 north-eastern counties that make up Northern Ireland opted to remain part of the UK.</p>
      <p class="active"> Fianna Fáil, the Irish republican party, gained a majority in the Irish Free State in 1927. Their explicit rejection of Northern Ireland's legitimacy increasingly put the Northern Irish government on the defensive, and fuelled a general sense of paranoia that the state would be attacked or overthrown by militant Irish nationalists.</p>
      <p>The Northern Irish government buildings were designed to give a sense of permanence to the state. Designed by Sir Arnold Thornely, the classical style of the building and its sheer scale both implicitly suggested that Northern Ireland was here to stay as a political body.</p>
      <p>The 1937 Éire constitution remains the legal basis of the Republic of Ireland to this day, only being amended through public referendums over the years. One of the key claims made in the 1937 document (and subsequently removed following the 1995 Good Friday Agreement) was a claim to administer to the entire territory of Ireland - including the 6 counties of Northern Ireland. The constitution introduced a competing head of state in Ireland (instead of the British Monarch): a president.</p>
      <p>Following the outbreak of war between the Allies and Axis forces in 1939, Northern Ireland (as part of the United Kingdom) mobilised and prepared for war. These preparations proved woefully inadequate in April-May 1941, when Belfast suffered some of the worst bombings seen in Britain outside of London. The carnage exposed the extent of the Stormont government's failings in both social provisions and the war effort itself.</p>
      <p>In 1948, Éire passed the Republic of Ireland Act, which finally removed any of the last vestiges of formal connections between the Irish state and Britain. In response, the British government passed the 1949 Government of Ireland Act, which essentially copperfastened the position of Northern Ireland within the United Kingdom. This solidification of Northern Ireland's status was considered by many to be a reward for Northern Ireland's (variable) performance during the Second World War, especially in comparison to Éire's neutrality.</p>
      <p>It is difficult to simply declare when the Northern Irish "Troubles" began, but early signs of nationalists declaring their dissatisfaction with the state can be seen in the first civil rights marches in August 1968. The attempts by nationalists and republicans to change or overthrow the Northern Irish state, and the reluctance of the Unionist establishment to accept any amendments, was one of the core tensions of the Troubles era.</p>
      <p>In January 1972, British army soldiers opened fire on a protest march in Derry/Londonderry in western Northern Ireland. That the protesters were unarmed caused a national outcry, and while an enquiry conducted shortly after the shootings found that the British soldiers had not been at fault, the Saville Enquiry reported in 2010 that none of those killed posed a threat. The British Prime Minister subsequently described the killings as 'unjustified and unjustifiable'.</p>
      <p>The 1998 Good Friday Agreement is commonly regarded as the peace agreement that marked the end of the 30 years of violence known as the Troubles. Granting recognitition of a right to British or Irish identity (or both) to those born in Northern Ireland, the agreement also saw significant concessions to people involved in paramilitary action during the conflict. The Agreement was approved by referendums in both jurisdictions in Ireland.</p>
